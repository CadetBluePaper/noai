This was meant for me to learn more about the GEMINI API and how agents work, so its not
really meant for proper use. I wouldn't reccomend using this code on your own machine, as I didn't 
implement any real security protcols, so if the directory is changed to a sensitive one, it could
mess stuff up (almost did that to myself lol). 

If you do want to run it, you will need a Gemini API key, aswell as .env file.
Here's a sample of my .env file:

GEMINI_API_KEY=""

FILE_CHARACTER_LIMIT=10000

MAX_FILE_CHARS=10000

WORKING_DIR="./your_directory_here"

SYSTEM_PROMPT="Your system prompt here"

I probably wont add any more features to this code, as it was just meant for me to learn and
experiment. Overall this was pretty fun to make, bye!
